    <h2 class="card-heading">Overview</h2>
    <p class="card-text">
      Fifth generation computers focus on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and natural language processing. They use very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and parallel processing, allowing millions or billions of transistors on a single chip. These computers are extremely fast, highly intelligent, and can handle complex problems that previous generations couldn’t. The goal is to create computers that can learn, reason, and make decisions like humans.
